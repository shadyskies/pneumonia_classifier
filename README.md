<b>Personal Project </b>

<h2>About:</h2>
Personal deep learning project based on convolution neural networks learnt during the quarantine period. Used a kaggle dataset containing >5000 images to train a model and achieved 0.83 recall, 0.91 precision and 0.87 f1-score. Learning rate reduction is used so as to improve training when learning rate stagnates. This project is made in collaboration with Naman Shah. The model is deployed on <strong>Heroku</strong> and the app can be found <a href="https://pnclassify.herokuapp.com/">here.</a>
A screenshot is attached below.
